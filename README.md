# Tweet Search

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that enables you to semantically search through some of Elon's tweets. WARNING: I didn't do any sort of moderation so be careful when reading results.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
